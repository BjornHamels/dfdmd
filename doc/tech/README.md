# Technical documentation

In some sort of blog-style, as I'm discovering how this works as I go.

## Gear

![Tektronix 7603](oldtektronix.png) Started out with my trusted 100Mhz non-storage crt large screen [Tektronix 7603](https://w140.com/tekwiki/wiki/7603) with my horizontal plugin [7B53A](https://w140.com/tekwiki/wiki/7B53A) with two vertical plugins: [7A16A](https://w140.com/tekwiki/wiki/7A16A) and [7A15A](https://w140.com/tekwiki/wiki/7A15A).

![Rigol MSO5104](newrigol.png) That got replaced by an 100Mhz 8GSa/s 4Ch [Rigol MSO5104](https://www.rigol.eu/products/oscillosopes/MSO5000%20series.html) with nearly all options (except the Mhz increase) which I got via a very good deal at eleshop.nl.

![DSLogic Plus](dslogic.png) My logic analyser is a DreamSourceLab [DSLogic Plus](https://www.dreamsourcelab.com/product/), 16 channels up to 400 Mhz.
